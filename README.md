# Clock-Detection
Course experiment of pressure gauge detection algorithm model
# Information
In the course experiment, several common object detection models are compared for pressure gauge detection. The pre training model of gluoncv is adopted, and Hough circle is also used to try Before cloning and running, you need to install the dependency package in requirements.txt
